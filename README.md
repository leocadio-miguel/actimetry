# actimetry
Actimetry data analysis. 
This is the first attempt to create an option to get a complete output of actimetry data. This is just a simple example of implementation, mainly based on PyActigraphy (https://github.com/ghammad/pyActigraphy). The next steps are to adapt this code to run light exposition data and to read a bunch of files at once.
